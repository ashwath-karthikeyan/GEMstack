# Run the following command for Town map 5 (It has city, highway, curb side and parking-lot locations)
# PLEASE NOTE THAT: Town05_Opt is not an HD map. If you have 16 GB GPU like in highbay, you can also make use of Town10HD_Opt with sync=true, which is essentially good for testing in-built perception

# for local testing with 4GB gpu ->
python config.py --map Town05_Opt --no-rendering --no-sync

# for local testing with 8+ GB GPU / highbay env
python config.py --map Town10HD_Opt --no-rendering

# While visualizing pointcloud on rviz, if you see Status: error, in a separate terminal, run the following command, and re-add point-cloud viz.

# To get prettier lidar viz on rviz, in it's conf under display, play around with decay and size.
