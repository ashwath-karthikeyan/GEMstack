Group 1 - Parking
Possible model: Empty parking space detection model
Result: Not found (only found bird eye view model)

Group 2 - Curbside parking
Possible model: Waving person detection model
Result: Possible but complex - People detection with gesture detection
Possible model: Empty parking space detection model
Result: See Group 1
Possible model: Object Detection - doors, sidewalk, and any obstacle
Result: YOLOv8 or mmDetection

Group 3 - Road driving
Possible model: Object Detection - sign, lane, and any obstacle
Result: YOLOv8 or mmDetection

Group 4 - Behavior prediction
Possible model: Pedestrian detection model
Result: They will handle it

Group 6 - State estimation
Possible model: Empty parking space detection model
Result: They will handle it, it seems they will use the model that I found for group 1
Possible model: Pedestrian detection model
Result: They will handle it - YOLOv8
